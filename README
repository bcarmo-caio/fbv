    Since the latest release (0.99) dates 24 Aug 2003 23:26 (on site) &&
    latest modification (1.0b) dates 2011-Jun-05 22:42:59 (on download site) &&
    LICENSE allows me =), I took the liberty of cloning the project here and
    making some changes. Probably I will end up with a small version of this
	project only to carry some image files, including animated gifs, just to
	make my booting time and coding in ttys time happier.
  Thank you.

1. OVERVIEW
    fbv (FrameBuffer Viewer) is a simple program to view pictures on
  a linux framebuffer device. In 2000, when fbv was created, there
  were no other situable programs performing the same task, so the
  authors decided to follow the rule: 'If you need a tool - write
  it yourself!' :-)

2. REQUIREMENTS
  - Linux, configured to provide the framebuffer device interface
    (/dev/fb0 or /dev/fb/0)
  - libungif for GIF support
  - libjpeg for JPEG support
  - libpng for PNG support

  !! maybe you'll have to:
     ln -s /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libgif.a /usr/lib/
     ln -s /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libgif.so[some version] /usr/lib/

3. INSTALLATION
  - unpack the archive (you've propably already done it)
  - run ./configure
  - type: make
  - type: make install
  - enjoy...

4. USAGE
    Just run fbv without any arguments, and a short help message
  will appear...

  authors are not native english speakers, and they are aware of the fact
  that their english is far from perfect. Because of that, reports on
  grammar and vocabulary mistakes in this file are also welcome.

6. BUGS & TODO
  - the code is really awfully formated and requires some fixes...
  - the english in messages is not the best at all :-)

7. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
  - the fbset authors: some code in fb_display.c is based on it...
  - Nat Ersoz - for his suggestions and bugfixes
  - Mauro Meneghin - for the transparent GIF support
  - Marcin 'Piaskowy' Zieba - for his minor bugfixes
  - Mariusz 'Ma-rYu-sH' Witkowski - for his suggestions on alpha
        channel support and testing
